The Poem BibTeX Entry
=====================

The ``@poem`` BibTeX entry would be simply a derivation of the ``@inbook`` format, except that the poem need not be in a book necessarily.


.. code-block::

   @poem{PoemAuthorYear,
		author    = {Author, A.},
		title     = {Title of the Poem},
		booktitle = {Title of the Collection},
		publisher = {Publisher},
		year      = {Year},
		editor    = {Editor, E.},
		volume    = {Volume},
		number    = {Number},
		series    = {Series},
		pages     = {123-145},
		address   = {City},
		edition   = {Edition},
		month     = {Month},
		note      = {Additional notes},
		key       = {Key},
		source    = {Medium if not a book},
		url       = {https://www.bibtex.org/}
	}
