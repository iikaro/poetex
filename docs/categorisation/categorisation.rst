Categorisation
==============

There seems to exist a lack on how to categorise and cite individual poems.
Not to mention other types of literature works that are independent or self-contained, such as chronicles and short-stories.

The most widespread standard for citation, BibTeX, contains no entry for poem.
One can argue the ``@inbook`` entry may fit the purpose.
According to BibTeX [#bibtex]_, ``@inbook`` is reserved for 'a section or chapter in a book'.
Naturally, individual poems do not constitute a section or chapter in the conventional way, and it seems far-fetched to try to fit poems into this category.
Another argument would be to use the ``@misc`` entry, which is 'used if nothing else fits'.
It seems reasonable that websites, flyers, interviews, audio recordings, and such fit into the miscellaneous category.
Those formats and technologies have appeared long after most of the BibTeX supported formats existed (books, collection, thesis).
However, poems are as old as books themselves. In fact, many poems are not contained in either books or anthologies.
It is reasonable to assume that poems deserve their own categorisation, in which the format in which it was published becomes a field, and not the opposite: an anthology book is cited where the poem is simply a page number.

As mentioned before, this argument applies to each individual piece of literature content that can be read and interpreted alone, such as chronicles and short-stories.
The fact that these pieces of literature are constantly gathered, reorganized and (re)published in different anthologies highlight how independent these works are.
Except for anthologies organized and published by their own writers, works published sparsely are mostly organized by publishers and whoever has their copyrights.
In many cases, these same publishers edit and re-publish many times these individual works in editions that often repeat themselves.
If one buys 'Contos Reunidos' [#contos]_ 'Duas narrativas fantásticas, A dócil e O sonho de um homem ridículo' [#narrativas]_ by the Brazilian publisher Editora 34, one will notice that one book contains into the other.
When it comes to referring to these works, the anthology that contains is mostly of no relevance compared to the poem one wants to cite.
The individual piece is of relevance, not the means in which is was published.

Therefore, the standard proposed here does not aim at decoupling the poem from the poem, but to assert the independent aspect of the poem, and categorise it as so.

A BibTex entry is proposed: ``@poem``, where the book that contains it becomes a mere field.
