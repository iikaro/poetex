Categorisation
==============

There exists a discernible gap in the systematic categorisation and citation methodologies applicable to individual poems, as well as other self-contained literary works, such as chronicles and short stories.
The prevailing standard for citation, namely BibTeX, lacks a dedicated entry for poems, even though one could argue the ``@inbook`` entry may fulfill the purpose.

According to BibTeX [#bibtex]_, ``@inbook`` is reserved for 'a section or chapter in a book'.
Naturally, individual poems do not constitute a section or chapter in the conventional way, and it seems far-fetched to try to fit poems into this category.

Another argument would be to use the ``@misc`` entry, which is 'used if nothing else fits'.
It seems reasonable that websites, flyers, interviews, audio recordings, and such fit into the miscellaneous category.
Those formats and technologies have appeared long after most of the canonical materials used as sources of information existed, which are the ones BibTeX supports (books, collection, thesis).
Nonetheless, poems, being as old as the very concept of books, merit a distinct categorisation.

Furthermore, the fact many poems are not contained in either books or anthologies emphasizes the need for a 'poem' entry.
In the proposed entry, the format of publication assumes the role of a distinct field, as opposed to the prevailing practice of citing a poem within an anthology or book as a mere page number.

Naturally, this argument extends to other standalone literary compositions, such as chronicles and short stories, each possessing an inherent independence that transcends their periodic inclusion in anthologies.
In fact, the recurrent gathering, reorganization, and (re)publication of these works in diverse anthologies underscore their autonomy.
With the exception of anthologies compiled and published by the original authors, sporadically published works are typically organized and reissued by publishers or copyright holders.

Notably, the structure of these editions may entail one work being encompassed within another.
Take for example the books 'Contos Reunidos' [#contos]_, a collection of short stories by Dostoevsky and 'Duas narrativas fantásticas, A dócil e O sonho de um homem ridículo' [#narrativas]_, a book with two novellas from the same author, both published by the Brazilian publisher Editora 34.
One will notice that the former edition contains the two novellas from the latter book.
The novellas are standalone pieces of literary work.
The books that contain them are, mostly certainly, not as important as the novellas.
Except for critical editions, where prefaces, footnotes, essays, and other pre- and post-textual elements contain information that will affect the way the work is consumed by the reader, the editions play a smaller role than they are attributed.
This is also true for many other works and authors worldwide.

In the context of citation, the anthology's relevance pales in comparison to the individual poem under consideration.
In most of the times, it is the singular literary work that holds significance, not the manner in which it is nested within an anthology.

Consequently, the proposed standard aims not to sever the poem from its inherent essence but rather to underscore its independent nature, advocating for a categorization that reflects this autonomy.

A suggested BibTeX entry, @poem, is put forth, wherein the containing book assumes a subsidiary role as a mere field, not the opposite, thereby acknowledging the distinctive character of the poem.
